## Creating a New Project

When beginning a new report, the first step is to create a new project
in RStudio. This can be done by clicking: 
  
<center> **File > New Project > New Directory > New Project** </center>

From there, specify the project name and the directory where you would like to 
save the project for the new report. To lessen confusion later, it is usually 
worthwhile to save each report in its own directory so that you can quickly and 
easily find the report at a later date.

## Structuring the Project Directories

Once the project has been created, the next step is to create the file structure 
for the report. To do this, begin by typing `library(here)` into the RStudio 
Console. Note, you will need to install the here package if it is not already 
installed. The here package can be installed by typing `install.packages("here)`.

After the here package has been installed and loaded, four project directories 
will need to be created. These four directories are:

- R/
- data-raw/
- data/
- output/

To create the R directory, type the command `dir.create(here("R"))`. This will 
create the folder, and you should be able to see it in your file directory at 
the lower right corner of your RStudio screen. The same process can be used to 
create the remaining three directories. 

The R directory is used to store analysis scripts.

The data-raw directory is used to store raw data files.

The data directory is used to store cleaned or intermediate files.

The output directory is used to store final output files that can be read into 
the report.
