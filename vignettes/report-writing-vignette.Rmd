## Creating a New Project

When beginning a new report, the first step is to create a new project
in RStudio. This can be done by clicking: 
  
<center> **File > New Project > New Directory > New Project** </center>

From there, specify the project name and the directory where you would like to 
save the project for the new report. To lessen confusion later, it is usually 
worthwhile to save each report in its own directory so that you can quickly and 
easily find the report at a later date.

## Structuring the Project Directories

Once the project has been created, the next step is to create the file structure 
for the report. To do this, begin by typing `library(here)` into the RStudio 
Console. Note, you will need to install the here package if it is not already 
installed. The here package can be installed by typing `install.packages("here)`.

After the here package has been installed and loaded, four project directories 
will need to be created. These four directories are:

- R/
- data-raw/
- data/
- output/

To create the R directory, type the command `dir.create(here("R"))`. This will 
create the folder, and you should be able to see it in your file directory at 
the lower right corner of your RStudio screen. The same process can be used to 
create the remaining three directories. 

The R directory is used to store analysis scripts.

The data-raw directory is used to store raw data files.

The data directory is used to store cleaned or intermediate files.

The output directory is used to store final output files that can be read into 
the report.

## Writing the Setup Chunk

The Setup Chunk is where you set all of the default settings for your report. 
In doing this, you want to create the Setup Chunk so that all of the necessary 
settings can be set in a reproducible way. In other words, you want the code to 
be able to run on any computer, not just yours.

The first step in doing this is to load the ratlas package. Bear in mind that 
not all computers will have the ratlas package installed already. Thus, the code 
in the Setup Chunk needs to test whether ratlas is already installed, install 
ratlas if it is not already installed, and load the ratlas package. 

This can be done by running the following code:

```{r load_ratlas, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(ratlas)
library(ratlas)
```

Additionally, the theme for ggplot should be specified. This can be done with 
the following code.

```{r set_ggplot_theme, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

```

Together, your first chunk of the file should look like:

```{r setup_chunk, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(ratlas)
library(ratlas)

```
