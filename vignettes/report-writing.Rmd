This vignette walks through the process of creating a new topic guide, technical report, or research report using R Markdown. We also suggest best practices for organizing your report files, and give some tips and tricks for formatting text.

## System Setup

In order to generate a report using the {ratlas}, you must have the necessary output software installed on your computer. For Microsoft Word output (e.g., `ratlas::topicguide_docx()`), you will need Word installed. For PDF output (e.g., `ratlas::techreport_pdf()`), you will need a $\LaTeX$ distribution. For an easy way to manage this, we recommend using the [{tinytex} package](https://yihui.org/tinytex/). If you have another $\LaTeX$ distribution already installed on your computer (e.g., MacTex on a Mac or MiKTeX on Windows), you should uninstall/delete that program before install {tinytex}. You can then be set up for PDF output by running this code (you only need to run it once after install {tinytex}):

```{r setup-tinytex, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

We also assume that you are using [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). This is not required, but RStudio provides many shortcuts that make the process of writing and generating reports much smoother.

## Creating a New Tech Report or Topic Guide

When beginning a new report, the first step is to create a new project in RStudio. This can be done by clicking: 
  
<center> **File > New Project > New Directory > Tech Report using ratlas** </center>

You can then choose a name for your project, and specify the location to save the project on your computer. To lessen confusion later, we recommend saving each report as a new project in its own directory so that you can quickly and easily find the report at a later date. Please note, this example will use the terminology for creating a new tech report, but the same steps can be used to create a new topic guide.

```{r create-report, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.subcap = c("Create a new project.", "Create project in a new directory.",  "Choose the type of report."), fig.cap = "Process for creating a new report with {ratlas}."}
include_graphics(c(here("vignettes", "images", "01-new-project.png"),
                   here("vignettes", "images", "02-new-directory.png"),
                   here("vignettes", "images", "03-techreport.png"),
                   here("vignettes", "images", "04-name-report.png")))
```

Your new project should open automatically. You can then open the R Markdown document by clicking the `.Rmd` file in the Files pane of the RStudio window. The `.Rmd` document will automatically be named with the name you gave your project. This will open up a document that looks similar to Figure \@ref(fig:name-report).

```{r name-report, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "Open the R Markdown file."}
include_graphics(here("vignettes", "images", "05-open-rmd.png"))
```

At this point, it's good practice to try generating the template report. We haven't made any changes, so generating the document using this template file ensures that your system is set up correctly. You can generate the document by pressing the `Knit` button in RStudio, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:knit-doc).

(ref:knit-doc-cap) Generate your document using the `Knit` button.

```{r knit-doc, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "(ref:knit-doc-cap)"}
include_graphics(here("vignettes", "images", "06-knit-doc.png"))
```

## Editing the Report




## Create and Cross Reference Tables

Tables can be created using the `kable()` function in the `kableExtra` package in R. 

To create a table, the `kableExtra` package takes an existing data frame (or tibble) and places the vectors (i.e., columns) into columns of the table. 

```{r filtered_iris, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
temp <- iris %>%
  filter(Petal.Length > 6.0) %>%
  arrange(desc(Petal.Length))

kable(x = temp, digits = 1, col.names = c("Sepal Length", "Sepal Width", 
                                          "Petal Length", "Petal Width", 
                                          "Species"), 
      align = "c", caption = "A table of irises with long petals", 
      booktabs = TRUE, format.args = list(big.mark = ","))
```

Additional information about the kableExtra package and cross referencing tables can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html).

## Create and Cross Reference Figures

Figures can be created using the `ggplot2` package in R. An example is included below.

```{r iris-fig}
iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Petal Length", y = "Sepal Length") + 
  theme_atlas()
```

Additional information about the `ggplot2` package and cross referencing figures can be found [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

## Best Practices

Because of how files within an R project are linked to one another, the best practice is to create a file structure that is organized and references directories without hard coding the directories. 

Four commonly used project directories, which may be useful, are:

- R/
- data-raw/
- data/
- output/

The `here()` function is designed to reference the directory where you have saved your project file, which is why it is recommended to create the project file first, followed by any needed .R or .Rmd files. 

As an example, the following code will create the "R" directory in your project folder: `dir.create(here("R"))`.

More information about best practices in file structure in R and the here package can be found [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/structuring-r-projects/). 

## Tips and Tricks

Code can be evaluated in-line so that the results are presented in the sentence without special formatting. For example, the code `` `r mean(iris$Petal.Length)` `` evaluates to 
`r mean(iris$Petal.Length)`. More information on in-line code can be found [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html).

The `English` package can be used to manipulate words and numbers into grammatically correct syntax. For example, `` `r knitr::combine_words(colnames(iris))` `` becomes `r knitr::combine_words(colnames(iris))`. More information on the `English` package can be found [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/english/versions/1.1-4).
