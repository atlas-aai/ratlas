## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. The previous submission raised-- 
   Check: Rd cross-references, Result: NOTE

   anchors:
     ratlas-ggproto.Rd: ggproto
     scale_atlas.Rd: discrete_scale
     scale_lcrost.Rd: discrete_scale
     scale_okabeito.Rd: discrete_scale
   Please provide package anchors for all Rd \link{} targets not in the
